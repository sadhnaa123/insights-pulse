Expect a rise in oat gum’s inclusion in energy bars, cereals, and health supplements.</li> <li><strong>Sustainability and Eco-Conscious Consumers:</strong> As sustainability becomes a bigger factor in consumer purchasing decisions, oat gum’s minimal environmental impact is likely to attract more market attention. This will help it maintain a competitive edge over other ingredients.</li> <li><strong>Expansion in Emerging Markets:</strong> Countries in Asia-Pacific and Latin America are increasingly embracing plant-based diets and functional foods, presenting significant growth opportunities for oat gum manufacturers.</li></ul><p>Analysts predict that the oat gum market could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15-20% from 2023 to 2033, with market size potentially reaching over $1 billion by the early 2030s.
